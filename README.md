This project provides a good consultation platform for doctors and patients,  through which patients can easily find the right doctor for consultation, and doctors can give diagnostic advice and prescribe the corresponding medicine for the    patient's illness. In addition, there is a robust forum for patients to discuss their conditions and for doctors to answer questions and post medical knowledge in a unified manner.
